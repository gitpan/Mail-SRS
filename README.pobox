Mail/SRS version 0.10
=====================

Sender Rewriting Scheme helps email forwarding (think
.forward or /etc/aliases) continue to work in an
SPF-compliant world.

Please see http://spf.pobox.com/srs.html

You should install this module through CPAN.

It is meant to cooperate with Mail::SPF::Query.

This entire module is PIPING HOT and VERY ALPHA.  It is
brand new and needs a fair amount of TLC from developers.

I expect a lot of people will look at this as a prototype
and write their own C versions for their MTAs.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
